# Identifying-Growth-Opportunities-Through-Business-Ownership-Analysis.
Objectives:

Analyze the US business landscape in 2021, focusing on firm demographics like sex, race, ethnicity, and veteran status.
Explore trends in firm longevity (years in business) across different demographic groups.
Identify potential disparities in business ownership and employment across demographic categories.
Data Source:

US Census Bureau's Annual Business Survey (ABS) 2021 Public Use File (ABSCS2021) - https://www.census.gov/abs
Methodology:

Utilized Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.
Created pivot tables and charts to analyze trends in firm demographics, years in business, and employment statistics.
Results:

Diversity in Ownership: The data revealed a diverse business ownership landscape, with a significant presence of female-owned, minority-owned, and veteran-owned businesses. 
Firm Longevity: Charts can be used to showcase findings on firm longevity across demographics (e.g., "Younger firms, with less than 2 years in operation, were more prevalent among Hispanic-owned businesses compared to non-Hispanic-owned businesses").
Employment Patterns: Data visualizations can reveal trends in employment across demographic categories (e.g., "Analysis of payroll data suggested that female-owned businesses employed a higher percentage of female workers").
Insights:

This analysis provides valuable insights into the current state of US business ownership, highlighting the presence of diverse ownership groups.
Identifying potential disparities in firm longevity and employment patterns can inform policy decisions aimed at fostering a more inclusive business environment.
Future Work:

Extend the analysis to include data from previous years to identify trends over time.
Investigate potential correlations between firm demographics and industry sectors.
